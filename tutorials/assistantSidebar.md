# The Assistant Sidebar

Currently available for [early access users](https://buy.stripe.com/3cs29sdqY7QadeU147) only.

The assistant sidebar is meant to give you more control in terms of how your file is processed. Instead of moving your file to Inbox, the sidebar will include suggestions for you to choose from.

But first, you'll need to follow these two steps to enable the feature:

1. Go to experimental features in the plugin settings and add your early access code
2. Go to the Hotkeys section in the main settings and search for `AI Note Companion: Show Assistant`. Then, simply assign a keyboard command.

Now for the actual functionality all you need to do is:

1. In your vault, press the keyboard command you just set up. The assistant sidebar should now appear to the right.
2. Then click on any of your files and you should see a number of actionable items inside the sidebar. For now, you can add suggested tags, aliases, and move your file to the suggested folder.

That's it! We are still actively developing this feature and will be happy to hear about any feedback/suggestions.
