What is Vault Access?

Vault Access in File Organizer 2000 refers to the plugin’s ability to manage and organize files within specific folders or paths in your Obsidian vault. By configuring Vault Access settings, you can specify which folders the plugin should monitor and organize. This allows you to control exactly where the File Organizer operates, ensuring it only affects the parts of your vault that you want it to.

## How Can I Maintain Privacy of Certain Files?

You can maintain the privacy of certain files by using the “Ignore Folders” feature in the File Organizer 2000 settings. Here’s how:
	1.	Go to the File Organizer Settings: Navigate to the “Vault Access” or “Path Configuration” section.
	2.	Locate the “Ignore Folders” Setting: You’ll find an option labeled “Ignore folders.”
	3.	Specify Folders to Ignore: Enter the paths of the folders you want the plugin to ignore, separated by commas (e.g., PrivateFolder1,SecretsFolder2). If you want the plugin to ignore all folders, you can enter *.

By specifying these folders, the plugin will exclude them from its organization processes, ensuring your sensitive or private files remain untouched.

## Do You Support Front Matter?

Yes, File Organizer 2000 supports front matter. The plugin provides an option to add similar tags directly into the front matter of your Markdown files. To enable this feature:
	1.	Navigate to the “Organization Preferences” Tab: In the plugin settings, go to the “Organization Preferences” section.
	2.	Enable “Add Similar Tags in Frontmatter”: Look for the setting named “Add similar tags in frontmatter” and toggle it on.

When this option is enabled, any similar tags generated by the plugin will be added to the front matter section of your files, helping you keep metadata organized and easily accessible.

## How Does Fabric Integration Work?

Fabric integration in File Organizer 2000 allows you to enhance your document formatting using Fabric-like prompt structures. Here’s how it works:
	1.	Enable Fabric Formatting:
	•	Go to the “Experiment” tab in the plugin settings.
	•	Find the option labeled “Enable Fabric-like Formatting” and toggle it on.
	2.	Download Fabric Prompts:
	•	Once enabled, a Fabric Prompt Manager will appear.
	•	Use the Fabric Prompt Manager to download or update prompts from the Fabric repository.
	•	These prompts are stored in a designated folder specified in your settings (e.g., fabricPaths).

 
	3.	Apply Fabric Prompts:
	•	The downloaded prompts are used to format your documents according to Fabric methodologies.
	•	When you process files, the plugin applies these prompts to enhance organization and structure.
