## If you are having issues with "License Key Invalid" 


- Make sure to use the same license key in vercel and in obsidian. If you forget it you can access it by going into vercel and navigate to setting > environment variables and reveal SOLO_API_KEY. (as shown below)

- Make sure SOLO_API_KEY is your license key and OPENAI_API_KEY is the openAI API key
