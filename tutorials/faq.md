**Q: What is meant by “Unlimited usage” included in the Lifetime Plan?**
A: If you purchase lifetime license. You'll use your own openAI API key, linked directly to your account and credits.

**Q: What is the difference between the plans One Year of Updates and Lifetime of Updates?**

One year of updates means that you will keep getting updates for one year, as we keep adding features and improving the app. But after that year, you'll keep the app in that state. It will be a functioning version of the app, but you will not get the latest updates past that date. 

Whereas the lifetime version means you'll always get new updates.


**Q: I’m interested in “Early access features”, will the new license key provide me with a different Plugin version?**
A: Yes. Experimental features are only be accessible to lifetime access users.


**Q: Should I invest in the Lifetime Access option, how is Premium customer support provided. Email ?**
A: Premium support is provided via email and Discord community. Plus an onboarding call can be provided at request.


**Q: What’s the process for upgrading from Hobby to Lifetime? The Stripe page only allows me to update my existing subscription**
(e.g. Monthly to Yearly)
A: It's possible via this link: https://app.fileorganizer2000.com/dashboard/pricing

**Q: Is Note Companion compatible with local LLMs?**

A: Note Companion can work with local LLMs, but the experience is currently not on par with GPT-4o in terms of performance and accuracy. Local models are generally adequate for simpler tasks like tag guessing and classification but require significant customization to match the quality of more advanced models. For instance, modifications like updating the "streamObject" function in the code may be necessary to ensure compatibility with tools like Ollama. While we aim to provide a fully local experience in the future, the current technology limits its practicality. We'd love to hear about your experiments to help improve support for local setups across the community!


**Q: Why can’t I send messages in FO2000 Discord channels?**

A: Some channels in the FO2000 Discord server are reserved for premium users. If you’ve purchased a license and still cannot access these channels, it’s likely your permissions have not yet been updated. Contact support with your Discord username, and the team will grant you access to the premium channels.

**Q: How can I use Note Companion to populate YAML frontmatter in Obsidian automatically?**
