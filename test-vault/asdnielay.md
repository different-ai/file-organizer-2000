This image shows a page with handwritten notes. The writing is a mix of phrases, some of which appear to be related to historical topics, and others that seem more personal or transactional. Here's a transcription of the legible parts of the text:

- $60
- [illegible text] 
- just paid x [Ema?]
- Writing A brief history of Japan
- (1) Samurai's [sic] overarching convention of acting on behalf of the emperor
- (2) in the 1930-40 [sic] Japan was mostly re under military rule

The handwriting is inconsistent, with some words more clearly written than others. It seems that the writer is making notes concerning the payment of $60, a mention of possibly having "just paid" someone or something, and an outline or headings for writing about a brief history of Japan. The two points about Japan's history refer to the role of samurais and the period of the 1930s to 1940s when Japan was under military influence.![[Ava/Processed/Attachments/1-2]]
