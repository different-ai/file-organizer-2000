The image displays two pages from a notebook with handwritten notes. The page on the left contains notes that appear to relate to the aftermath of the Fukushima disaster in Japan and includes the following:

- Japan post-Fukushima
  - What is/not reported:
  - Resilient infra[structure]

- Learning
  - Power could not be diverted
  - There were safety measures in place.
  - There was ~ report describing how they were not sufficient.
  - Simply by returning to Fukushima left-overs
  - Created other nuclear incidents

The page on the right seems to contain information about a historical law in Japan:

- Aba Shindo
  - Sekoku
    - 17th century law that banned Japanese w/ 3 foreign grand parents

These notes seem to be reminders or topics for further study or elaboration, possibly part of a larger research project or study notes. The notes about the aftermath of the Fukushima disaster touch on issues of what was and was not reported regarding the resilience of infrastructure and the effectiveness of safety measures put in place. The note on the right with "Aba Shindo" might refer to an individual and the term "Sekoku" seems to refer to the period of national isolation in Japan, but the specifics about the law mentioning "banned Japanese w/ 3 foreign grandparents" is unclear and may be a personal summary or interpretation of a historical law related to national identity or citizenship. It's worth noting that the actual term from Japanese history is "Sakoku," which was the isolationist foreign policy of Japan under which relations and trade between Japan and other countries were severely limited. The notes may contain a typographical error in the spelling of this term.![[Ava/Processed/Attachments/Scanned Document-4-2]]
