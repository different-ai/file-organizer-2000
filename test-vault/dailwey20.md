This week I had two interviews with a top accelerator, and it prompted me to revisit my self-worth. I went to New York for an in-person interview. I wanted to show up as my best self. But, moments before the interview, I could feel myself stressed out, afraid, and unsure.

I couldn't explain why I felt that way. Sure, I could get a no in the interview and there was a lot of money on the line. 

But I felt pretty happy about myself and my business partner. I had deep inner conviction that we had it in us to make something great.

I thought I could get where I want to be, faster. But in reality the place that I need to get to faster to doesn't require any money. It's accessible to me instantly. It's a version of me.

I'm writing this to myself in the hope I'll remember in the future, that it's about creating the conditions that give me access to this person as much as possible. As long as I am him, I'm on the right path. My best self is not the one that shows up for the interview. My best self is made every day.

The perfect life for me is not in the future. It's a life I get to live right here, right now.

But I still get to have aspirations. I have the aspiration to build great things, because I know that this is what my best self deserves to do.

My best self is allowed to doubt himself. Self-doubt is an amazing tool. I've used it and I'll continue using it. I'll use internal dialogue to push my own inner conviction.

I want to build something I believe I'm the best at.

I don't want to be the second best. And even though I use the word "best", it doesn't really reflect any objective belief. It does not reflect the opinion of a VC, some newspaper, or what my friends think. It reflects inner conviction that I'm on the right path.

I don't want to hedge my bets, I don't want to play it safe, I don't want a plan C. I want to live plan A, every day.
