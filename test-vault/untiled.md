The image you've shared shows a page with various handwritten notes. The writing appears to be someone's personal notes or draft thoughts, possibly for an essay or study purposes. I am unable to read everything clearly due to the handwriting style and image quality, but I can provide a rough transcription of some parts:

- The top of the page has some text including what looks like a price or an amount ($60).
- Below that is the phrase "just paid x Emi," suggesting that someone has made a payment to a person named Emi.
- The larger section seems to start with the title "A brief hist(ory) of Japan" followed by bullet points or numbered points. One bullet point mentions "samurais" and "overhauling a convention" and "acting on behalf of the emperor." This indicates the topic may pertain to certain aspects of Japanese history and the role of samurai.
- Another point mentions "in the 1930-40 Japan was mostly under military rule," pointing to a historical period when Japan indeed was under military influence, especially before and during World War II.

The rest of the content is not clearly discernible due to the handwriting and the overwriting in some areas. The notes seem to be in the process of organization or are quick reminders for the writer.![[Ava/Processed/Attachments/Scanned Document-1-2]
