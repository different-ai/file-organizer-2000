The image shows a handwritten note spread across two pages. The writing on these pages appears to be notes about historical events and periods, particularly focusing on Japanese history. Here are the transcriptions from both pages:

Left Page:
- Emperor Showa's "Declaration" of Humanity.
- Rape of Nanjing
- Bataan Death March
- "Comfort Women"
He helped shut down the [word unclear, possibly 'Soldier's'] revolt in 1936.
Keeping continuity
[Words unclear]
General MacArthur chose to keep the emperor in power.

Right Page:
Why and how did Japan's US occupation lead to its financial superpower?
-1947 activation of new constitution
- Universal Suffrage

Period: 1603 - 1868 = Edo period
Tokugawa shogunate

Ieyasu
[Words unclear in a blue box, possibly corrections or notes]
[Words crossed out]
shogun + daimyo
The emperor's role was to legitimize the shogun's rule [word unclear]
The samurai were a warrior class who served the shogun & daimyo

The notes on the left page refer to several significant and tragic events associated with Japan during the Second World War and touch upon the role Emperor Showa (Hirohito) played in those times. It also mentions the continuity of the emperor's position, a decision influenced by General Douglas MacArthur during the American occupation of Japan after WWII.

The notes on the right page appear to be more focused on the period of Japan's history known as the Edo period, characterized by the rule of the Tokugawa shogunate. It references the establishment of a new constitution in 1947, granting universal suffrage, a step towards Japan becoming a financial superpower post-WWII. The notes briefly describe the roles of the shogun, daimyo, and emperor during the Edo period and mention the samurai class.![[Ava/Processed/Attachments/Scanned Document-2]]
