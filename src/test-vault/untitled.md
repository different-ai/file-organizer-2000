## History of Silicon Valley
- 1951 Fred term-an created Stanford research park
- 1956 William Shockley father of the semi-conductor launched his company on the Stanford campus
- 1957 defection of traitorous eighit to found Fairchild Semiconductor
> “defection of 1957 was made possible by a new form of finance, originally dubbed adventure capital. The idea was to back technologists who were too dicey and penurious to get a conventional bank loan but who promised the chance of a resounding payoff to investors with a taste for audacious invention. The funding of the Traitorous Eight and their company, Fairchild Semiconductor, was arguably the first such adventure to take place on the West Coast, and it changed the history of the region. After Fairchild got its $1.4 million in financing, it became evident that any team in the Valley possessed of grand ideas and stiff ambition could spin itself out, start itself up, and generally invent the organizational form that best suited its fancy”
- 1960s finance proffesors emphasize diversification while VCs were making use of power laws (through metis see [[Mētis vs Techne]])
- 1966 [[Davis & Rock]] featured in a Fortune article that created many copy-cats
- 1970s by that time vc started looking a lot like it does today

Concentration of smart people & capital
> “A brilliant person can do great things. A large group of people can try many things. Through an evolutionary process of trial, failure, and occasional breakthroughs, the group may advance faster than the individual.”

## Circular Logic for the win

> “the case of Apple, VCs were being told that they should invest simply because others were investing. However circular this logic, it was by no means crazy.”

> “Apple’s managers or the quality of its products might be secondary. If Apple was attracting funding, and if its reputation was soaring thanks to well-connected backers, its chances of hiring the best people and securing the best distribution channels were improving, too. Circular logic could be sound logic”

Story of Cisco
> “Lerner and Bosack set out to fix this problem; according to later Cisco lore, they wanted to send love notes to each other. First they solved the engineering problem of connecting two networks that used different protocols”

Sandy Lerner was too difficult & Don Valentine fired her
Besack left in response
