The image shows two pages of handwritten notes.

On the left page, the notes are about "Japan post-Fukushima" and mention what is not reported, specifically resilient infrastructure. It goes on to list a few points:
- Warning
- Power could not be diverted
- There were safety measures in place.
- There was a report describing how they were not sufficient.

The note concludes with an intriguing statement about how returning to Fukushima left-overs created other major incidents.

On the right page, the notes focus on "Abe Shinzo" referring to the former Prime Minister of Japan, Shinz≈ç Abe. It mentions "Sakoku," indicating a term related to Japan's period of isolation, and notes that it is a 17th-century law that turned Japan away from three foreign grand parents.

The notes seem to be bullet points or summaries, perhaps for a study or a write-up on the indicated topics.![[Ava/Processed/Attachments/Scanned Document-4]]
