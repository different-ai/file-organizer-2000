**Most hobbies need some capital to get started.** Sometimes you need to buy a single element (e.g. you need a guitar to play guitar), a series items (you need coffee and some form of infusion/percolation to brew coffee), and other times even lessons (you need take driving lessons to pass your driver license).

What I noticed is that most of the times, **as beginner you'll have an extremely skewed vision about what tools bring to the table.**

When I first got into filter coffee, I thought a good brew would require a good brewer. So I invested around $200-300 in a good brewer. And I learned the hard way (through many failed cups) that the brewer has very little impact on my cup quality. 

What then followed was a over 1 year old rabbit hole of trying things out: buying a ($100) grinder, getting better beans, trying a gazillion different grind settings, buying 5 different brewer. 

And it is not until very recently that I was able to make consistently better cups of coffee.

Then it struck me, I could've spend significantly less money to make great coffee.

If you ask me what I would need today to make great coffee, I believe would be able to make great coffee with significantly less upfront investment ($100 vs $300).

Not only that, but if you asked me to increase the budget I would funnel the money in very ratios (e.g. i would spend significantly more on a grinder than on a brewer).

This is not an isolated experience, I play various instruments, I'm also into photography, and pick up hobbies quite often.

All of them share the same pattern, what I think creates quality in the early days is completely skewed. 


| Activity            | Expectations That Will Yield Higher Quality  | Reality                                     | Reasons                                                                                                                                                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Brewing Filter Coffee      | Spend on a good brewer                      | Focus on a quality grinder and beans         | Using a better grinder, good beans, and quality water creates more predictable brews, leading to consistently great coffee.                               |
| Playing Guitar      | Invest in an expensive bran new electric guitar, amps, and pedals      | Start with a decent quality guitar and use a computer as an amplifier | The key is to get to a sound you enjoy quickly, and starting with a basic setup allows for a smaller feedback loop and lower cost.                    |
| Photography         | Choose a high-end digital camera            | Begin with a film camera for better learning | Film cameras simplify the learning process by removing complexities like post-processing, offering a cost-effective way to achieve pleasing results. |
| Other Hobbies       | Assume expensive equipment equals quality   | Prioritize learning and skill development over costly gear | Focusing on skill development over costly equipment is more effective and budget-friendly, leading to better quality outcomes in the long run.   |

The bottom line is that when you pick up a hobby you'll struggle to understand what to pay attention or not attention to. 

Focusing on tools that shorten the feedback loop, reducing upfront costs, and removing unnecessary complexity will create a better experience as you get into a new hobby.
