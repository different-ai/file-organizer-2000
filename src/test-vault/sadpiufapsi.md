The image you've shared is a photograph of two pages from a notebook with handwritten notes. There are two distinct sections, each with its own heading.

On the left page, the heading reads "Japan post-Fukushima," and the notes beneath discuss issues related to what was reported about resilient infrastructure following the Fukushima disaster. It mentions that there was a narrative around safety measures in place but also reports describing how they were not sufficient. The text also mentions "Fukushima left-overs" leading to other nuclear incidents, suggesting some ongoing issues or consequences.

On the right page, the heading is "Abe ShinzO," which refers to the former Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe (although the last letter in the surname appears to be a 'O' rather than 'o'). Under this heading, there's a note about "Sokoku," which is possibly a reference to a historical or cultural concept. It is followed by a note stating "17th century law that banned Japanese w/ 3 foreign grand parents," which might be referring to a historical law related to foreign ancestry, but the details are not fully clear from the notes alone.

It is worth mentioning that in historical contexts, Japan did have policies and laws related to national isolation (sakoku) and control of foreign influence, especially between the 17th and 19th centuries. However, without additional context, it's difficult to provide a precise explanation of these mentionings in the notebook. It's also important to note that when referring to written notes like these, there can often be some discrepancies or inaccuracies that are not reflective of historical facts.![[Ava/Processed/Attachments/4-2]]
