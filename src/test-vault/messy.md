The image shows a page with handwritten notes. The notes appear to be related to different subjects and are somewhat difficult to read due to the handwriting and some words being crossed out or overwritten. At the very top, there seems to be a dollar amount written as "$60". Below, there is a series of lines indicating text, with a few words legible here and there. The middle section contains a phrase within a box that reads "just paid x [time]", but the word where "time" should be is not clear. Further down, there are some more legible notes that discuss the history of Japan, referencing the role of samurais and a period of military rule in the 1930s-40s. Here's a rough transcription of what's legible:

- "$60"
- "[text]"
- "just paid x [time]"
- "A brief history of Japan [...] samurais overthrew a convention of acting on behalf of the emperor"
- "in the 1930-40 Japan was mostly under military rule"

It appears to be someone's personal study notes or ideas, written in a stream-of-consciousness or brainstorming style.![[Ava/Processed/Attachments/Scanned Document-1]]
