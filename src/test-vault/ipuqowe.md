It was also not until the Occupation forces had left that there was any widespread discussion of issues that they had suppressed, such as the nature of collateral damage from atomic weapons. This became a cause celebre in 1954, when a Japanese fishing boat, the Daigo Fukuryū-maru (Lucky Dragon V), was caught in the fallout from one of the US atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands.

It was not lost on Japanese conservatives that the Americans were using the hulks of Japan’s once-great navy, and the islands that had once been Japanese mandates, to test their doomsday weapons. When the radio operator of the Daigo Fukuryū-maru died as a result of complications from radiation sickness, he did so uttering, “I pray that I am the last victim of an atomic or hydrogen bomb.”

**He was not.** 

“Famously, the incident also inspired one of the box-office blockbusters of 1954, director Honda Ishirō’s Gojira (Godzilla), which reimagined the threat of nuclear destruction as a giant monster marching on Japan’s slowly recovering cities, unleashing a new menace.”
