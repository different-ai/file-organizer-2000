   ```
   And make sure you have your `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable set up in your `.env.local` file inside the `packages/web` directory. If you want to use Amazon Bedrock models, you'll also need to configure AWS credentials (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`).

   ```sh
   cd packages/web; pnpm build:self-host; pnpm start

## How to use

### A. AI Organizer

Get suggestions and choose what to apply with the Assistant view. Here's how to use it:

1. Click on the Assistant View Icon or set up the "Show Assistant" hotkey to open the Sidebar
2. Select any of your files and choose which changes to apply

### B. AI Inbox

Auto-organize with the AI Inbox.

We recommend the AI Assistant view for more control. But the AI Inbox can be handy as well. Simply move any of your files to the "Inbox" folder and the plugin will automatically move it to the folder it belongs. Additional configuration can also be specified within the plugin settings (e.g. auto-tagging, auto-formatting).

Move your unorganized files into `_FileOrganizer2000/Inbox`

It takes a sec, and then renames, and organizes your file.

See plugin settings to customize the changes AI Inbox applies to your files.

### C. Create custom AI Templates

Give instructions for the AI to format and modify your files.
