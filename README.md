## How to use

### A. AI Assistant View

Get suggestions and choose what to apply with the Assistant view. Here's how to use it:

1. Click on the Assistant View Icon or set up the "Show Assistant" hotkey to open the Sidebar
2. Select any of your files and choose which changes to apply

### B. AI Inbox

Auto-organize with the AI Inbox.

We recommend the AI Assistant view for more control. But the AI Inbox can be handy as well. Simply move any of your files to the "Inbox" folder and the plugin will automatically move it to the folder it belongs. Additional configuration can also be specified within the plugin settings (e.g. auto-tagging, auto-formatting).

Move your unorganized files into `_FileOrganizer2000/Inbox`

It takes a sec, and then renames, and organizes your file.

See plugin settings to customize the changes AI Inbox applies to your files.

### C. Create custom AI Templates

Give instructions for the AI to format and modify your files.

To use llama 3.2 with the ai chat, install Ollama + llama 3.2 and check this setting in the plugin:

### B. Self-hosting

1. Run the server

   For Linux/macOS:

   ```

   And make sure you have your `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable set up in your `.env.local` file inside the `packages/web` directory.

   For Windows (PowerShell):

   ```sh
   cd packages/web; pnpm build:self-host; pnpm start
   ```

   And make sure you have your `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable set up in your `.env.local` file inside the `packages/web` directory.

### C. Development Setup

This is a monorepo using pnpm workspaces and Turborepo. To get started:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Build all packages:
   ```sh
   pnpm build
   ```

3. Development commands:
   - Start web development server: `cd packages/web && pnpm dev`
   - Build plugin: `cd packages/plugin && pnpm build`
   - Build audio server: `cd packages/audio-server && pnpm build`

The project consists of the following packages:
- `packages/plugin`: The Obsidian plugin
- `packages/web`: The web application
- `packages/audio-server`: Audio transcription server
- `packages/shared`: Shared utilities and types

For the tech-savvies who would like to play around with different models, there is a promptfoo.yaml file in the project including examples with local LLMs.

how to set it up: https://youtu.be/zWJgIRlDWkk?si=HSeOUKaMfJvaLtKI

Notes:
- It works when your vault is on a cloud drive. I use it with iCloud and works great. Doesn't work with OneDrive last time I tested.
- Currently only works if your iOS is in English. But if you reach out on discord I can help you set it up in your language.

## To Do

- [ ] Release a local LLM-only version.
- [ ] Implement browser access into AI chat.
- [ ] AI chat improvements.

### Notes

This plugin interacts with your filesystem.
